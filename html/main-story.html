    <h1>The Hero of Mactan</h1>
    <p>
        In the Battle of Mactan on April 27, 1521, Lapulapu, a native of the archipelago, defeated Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. He is credited with being the first to have resisted Spanish colonization. Datu Lapulapu is also known under the names Ã‡ilapulapu, Si Lapulapu, Salip Pulaka, Cali Pulaco, and Lapulapu Dimantag.

    <h1>The Controversy about the Battle of Mactan</h1>
    <p>
        In the midnight of April 27, 1521, along with 20 to 30 war boats (karakoa) of Humabon's warriors from Cebu, Magellan led a force of about 60 armored Spanish soldiers. Three hours before dawn, they landed in Mactan. However, coral reefs and rock outcroppings prevented Magellan's ships from making a landfall on Mactan's shores. They were compelled to anchor their ships "two crossbow flights" off the shore. They came up against 1,500 Lapulapu warriors, according to Antonio Pigafetta, who were armed with iron swords, arrows, and "bamboo" spears.

        Lapulapu once more refused Magellan's offer to refrain from attacking them in exchange for its oath of allegiance to Rajah Humabon, obedience to the Spanish king, and payment of tribute. The battle did not start until the morning at Lapulapu's mocking demand. Magellan instructed the warriors of Humabon to stay aboard their ships, probably in an effort to impress them with the superiority of European armor and weapons. To confront Lapulapu's men, Magellan and 49 of the heavily armored Spaniards plunged into the water. They were armed with lances, swords, crossbows, and muskets. In an effort to frighten them, they set fire to a few cottages along the shore. Instead, the warriors of Lapulapu grew angry and charged. A poisoned arrow struck Magellan in the leg, and two Spaniards were instantly slain in the struggle.

        With the exception of a handful who stayed to guard him, he ordered a retreat, which was followed by the majority of his soldiers. But when the natives identified him as the captain, he was the target of the assault. Magellan's forces swiftly succumbed to the superior numbers of the enemy and the weight of their armor. While some of Magellan's men perished, the majority managed to flee to the waiting ships.

        18 soldiers from the Spanish forces were permitted to go back to their country. A sanctuary was provided by Humabon for nine (9) survivors. Magellan's death resulted in Lapulapu, the battle's champion, ordering Humabon to execute the survivors. When Humabon objected, he sold the surviving to Chinese traders as slaves.

        Magellan was killed by a Boholano, Sampong Baha, but the honor was given to Lapulapu.

        When the expedition arrived in the Philippines in March 1521, relations with the locals changed from pleasant fruit trade to violent conflict (as shown in this engraving). in a fierce conflict. On April 27, Magellan perished on Mactan Island.

        When Magellan died, Antonio Pigafetta wrote down his observations as an eyewitness. "He (Magellan) was struck by an arrow on the thigh, just above the knee," he claimed. He stumbled and hit his other knee; he was unable to draw his sword. A man approached and cut our leader, Magellan, by the neck with a broadsword (escudo). Magellan was unable to run since an arrow had struck his knee. When the broadsword-wielding man approached, he hacked off Magellan's neck. Sampong Baha, the one with the broadsword, was the one who actually killed Magellan. However, as a result of our Americanized education, we have a tendency to discount the local accounts.
