            The story of Lapulapu and the Battle of Mactan offers two powerful lessons: the strength of early Filipino resistance and the importance of questioning how history is told. On April 27, 1521, Lapulapu refused to surrender to Ferdinand Magellan, rejecting an offer to pledge loyalty to Rajah Humabon and pay tribute to the Spanish king. This act of defiance led to a fierce battle where Lapulapu’s 1,500 warriors, armed with iron swords, arrows, and bamboo spears, overwhelmed Magellan’s 49 heavily armored men. The terrain worked in their favor—coral reefs kept Spanish ships from landing close, and the heavy armor of the Spaniards slowed them down. When Magellan’s men set fire to local homes, the warriors responded with anger and determination, ultimately defeating the foreign invaders.

            While Lapulapu is rightly celebrated as the hero of Mactan, some accounts suggest the story may be more complex. Eyewitness Antonio Pigafetta wrote that Magellan was wounded and then struck by a man with a broadsword. One source claims that the man was Sampong Baha, a warrior from Bohol. This detail doesn’t diminish Lapulapu’s leadership—it adds depth to the story and reminds us that history is often shaped by the voices that survive. Over time, education systems and popular retellings may simplify events, leaving out local perspectives and alternative truths. Recognizing this complexity helps us appreciate the richness of our past and encourages us to look beyond the surface.

            By reflecting on the Battle of Mactan, we honor the courage of early Filipinos and learn to approach history with both pride and curiosity. Lapulapu’s refusal to yield and his role in leading the resistance are undeniable, but acknowledging the possibility of other contributors like Sampong Baha allows us to see history not as a fixed tale, but as a living narrative shaped by many voices. This deeper understanding enriches our connection to the past and strengthens our sense of identity.
